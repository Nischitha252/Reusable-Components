What the paper is about? 

The paper proposes a method to automatically detect and classify symbols in engineering drawings.
Instead of humans manually identifying symbols, a computer can:

Find the legend table.

Extract each symbol and its name from that table.

Search the whole diagram to find where those symbols appear.

Count and classify them correctly.

This means the system learns the “dictionary” of symbols from the legend and then applies it to the entire drawing.

The step-by-step idea

Find the Legend Table

Either use image processing (detect lines, rectangles, and look for the word "LEGEND")

Or use a deep learning model (Faster R-CNN) to detect the legend box, even if it looks different.

Extract Symbols + Text

Split the table row by row.

Separate the symbol (image) on the left from the name (text) on the right.

Remove junk rows like headers that don’t contain symbols.

Locate Symbols in the Diagram

Train an object detection model (Faster R-CNN again) to scan the whole diagram and find regions that look like symbols (ignoring lines, arrows, etc.).

Match Symbols with the Legend

Instead of training a classifier for every possible symbol (impossible, since symbols vary a lot), they treat it like an image similarity problem.

Example: if you detect a shape in the drawing, compare it with each symbol in the legend and pick the closest match.

They use SIFT (feature extractor) or a Siamese network to measure similarity.
